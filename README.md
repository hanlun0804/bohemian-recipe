# Bohemian recipe

This project was developed as part of the course "Web development" at NTNU. The website displays different dishes you can make in a modern and clean manner, 
and lets you filter and sort based on your preferences. You can click on a certain dish to see the recipe, and give it a rating. This rating will help other users 
see which dishes are considered the most delicious.

We used React, TypeScript and MongoDB to develop this project. I learnt more about the backend side of development, as I had mainly worked with frontend before this 
project. I think it is the couse I have learnt the most from so far in my studies, and can highly recommend it as an interesting and relevant course to any aspiring 
developers.

We sadly could not host the website anymore, due to NTNU taking down the VMs the database and site was running on. Please feel free to contact me at 
hanlun0804@outlook.com regarding any questions or feedback you might have. And have a nice day!
