# Documentation from the developers

## Description of the project Bohemian Recipe

The project involves a web page with the possibility to display decadent meals and recipes.

## Functional requirements

The user is presentet with a search bar with the planned possibility to search for whatever one might please to eat. It is also planned to add a filtering possibility in the later version so that the user can filter origin of dish, category (meat, vegetarian, drinks...). All filter choises will be saved in a local storage later. Responsive design has been a focus point during the development. We started developing the web page in Figma with a focus on design and a great user interface and user experience.

## Technical requirements

Bohemian Recipe is based on typescript and react. We display regularly on different devices.

## Development and testing instructions

We have used Node.js v20.5+ and npm v9.8+ and created the project using vite 4.4 where we used the project type React and Typescript. Through our prosess we have taken advantage of linting and Prettier.
